Chapter 1: Crimson

Ah, pain, my old friend. How delightful it is to meet you again.

Zhou Mingrui's head was pounding like a jazz drummer on a caffeine high, a sensation akin to having his skull used as a piñata at a sadistic child's birthday party. Though, if he were to be precise, it felt more like someone decided that his temples needed a new piercing—minus the artistic flair.

"Great," he thought. "Just another night in my personal house of horrors." Despite his best efforts to roll over or even sit up, Zhou Mingrui's limbs remained as responsive as a bureaucrat on lunch break. So this was the latest installment in his recurring nightmare series. He could almost feel the laugh track as he lay there, paralyzed.

"Wake up, Zhou," he mentally barked at himself. But his thoughts flitted around like moths in a streetlight, refusing to be corralled into anything useful.

"Why now? Why this headache from hell? Am I dying?" he wondered, entertaining images of cerebral calamities. "Dying young... Great, just great."

But then, the pain dialed down from torturous to merely excruciating. "Fantastic. Now it's like a blunt knife's having a field day in my brain," he mused sarcastically. "Guess I won't be making it to work. Silver linings."

Finally, Zhou Mingrui managed to gather enough strength to peel open his eyes, breaking free from his fevered dreams. A crimson hue bathed his world, like a bad filter on a noir film.

In front of him, a sturdy wooden desk held an open notebook with pages yellowed like a smoker's teeth. The letters on it were ominously dark, probably something about the futility of life or the weather. To the left, a stack of books was piled with military precision. On the right, grayish-white pipes played a decorative role, snaking into a wall lamp that screamed "Western kitsch."

An ink bottle with a blurry angelic motif and a revolver sat on the desk, both enveloped in the same eerie red glow. Zhou Mingrui blinked. A revolver? Really? This wasn't his room; it was a bad set from a period drama.

His eyes wandered to the window. There it was, a crimson moon hanging in the sky like a brooding theater prop. "Lovely," Zhou thought, his curiosity mingling with a good dose of dread.

Standing abruptly, Zhou Mingrui's body reminded him it had a headache to nurture, sending him crashing back into the chair with indignant velocity. He wrestled himself upright, casting a panicked look around.

The room was straight out of a budget historical reenactment. Two doors, a low wooden bed, a cupboard with drawers that had seen better days, and some mechanical contraption with gears exposed for dramatic effect. The right corner boasted a coal stove ensemble, complete with pots and utensils. A dressing mirror with cracks that whispered of past traumas stood opposite the right door.

In the mirror, a stranger stared back: black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, and features that screamed "average Joe with a scholarly twist."

"Is this me now?" Zhou Mingrui wondered, his mind racing through a lifetime of reading web novels. Transmigration, a fantasy he had once entertained for amusement, was now his reality.

He took deep breaths, trying to summon calm from the chaotic storm in his head. As clarity emerged, memories flooded in—Klein Moretti, recent graduate in history, citizen of Loen Kingdom, Tingen City, and fully paid-up member of the "families with tragic backstories" club.

Father, a fallen sergeant. Mother, a devout of the Evernight Goddess, now resting in peace. Elder brother, the family's financial lifeline. Younger sister, adding to the familial charm. And here he was, Klein Moretti, history aficionado with a knack for dead languages and a penchant for bad luck.

As Zhou's—no, Klein's—gaze fell on the notebook, the strange letters morphed into something comprehensible: the Hermes language, his academic specialty. "Everyone will die, including me," it read. Brilliant, just what he needed for a motivational poster.

Reeling, he nearly toppled backward, his hand catching the table's edge. The air around him seemed to vibrate with whispers, ghostly tales told by candlelight. Shaking his head, Zhou—Klein—tried to dispel the illusions.

His eyes fell upon the revolver. "Where did Klein get this?" he wondered. The Moretti family finances couldn't stretch to such luxuries.

Then, the red handprint caught his eye, a deeper shade than the moon's light. A bloody handprint. His own hand, painted with crimson, confirmed it.

"Did I crack my head open?" he speculated, making his way to the mirror. The face staring back seemed vaguely familiar yet foreign, like a character from a novel he'd once read.

In the dim light, he examined his temple, where a grotesque wound with burn marks nestled. Blood and grayish brain matter completed the macabre scene. 

"Fantastic," he thought, the sarcasm practically dripping from his mind. "Welcome to your new life, Klein Moretti."
