Chapter 1: Crimson

Zhou Mingrui awoke to a splitting headache, as if a pole had repeatedly struck his skull or a sharp object had pierced his temples and twisted. He attempted to move, to sit up, but found his limbs unresponsive, trapped in a dream-like paralysis.

Still dreaming, he thought. But the pain was too real, too intense. Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? Am I dying? He struggled to focus, to break free from the fog engulfing his mind.

Gradually, the pain lessened, though it still felt like a blunt knife was slicing through his brain. Eventually, he could move his back and open his eyes. His vision was initially blurred, then tinged with a faint crimson.

Before him lay a study desk made of sturdy wood. An open notebook with coarse, yellow pages sat in the center, its title scrawled in strange black lettering. To the left, a stack of eight books was neatly arranged. Grayish-white pipes ran along the wall, connecting to a Western-style lamp that cast a pale red glow over the scene.

A black ink bottle, embossed with a blurry angel, sat beneath the lamp. Beside it lay a dark pen and a brass revolver. A revolver? Zhou Mingrui was shocked; these items were foreign to him.

The desk, notebook, ink bottle, and revolver were all shrouded in a crimson veil, cast by the light from a window. He looked up to see a crimson moon hanging in the sky, set against a black velvet backdrop.

Overwhelmed, Zhou Mingrui stood abruptly, only for his head to throb with renewed intensity. He fell back into the chair, the pain momentarily paralyzing him before he forced himself up again to survey the room.

The small room had a brown door on each side, a low wooden bed against the opposite wall, and a cabinet with open doors and five drawers. A strange mechanical device with exposed gears was connected to the wall's grayish-white pipe. Kitchen utensils were clustered in the right corner near the table.

A dressing mirror with two cracks stood across the right door. Zhou Mingrui caught a glimpse of himself: black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, thin build, and average features.

Could I have transmigrated? The thought struck him as he examined the revolver and the crimson moon, both distinctly unearthly.

Memories flooded in: Klein Moretti, a citizen of Loen Kingdom, Tingen City, a recent history graduate. His father, an army sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict, and his mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, had passed away when he entered university. Klein lived with an elder brother and younger sister, supported by the brother's clerk job.

Zhou Mingrui focused on the notebook again. The text on its yellowed pages shifted from strange to familiar, revealing the Hermes language. It read: "Everyone will die, including me."

Instinctively, he recoiled, nearly toppling over but catching the table's edge. A red handprint marked the table; his own hand was stained with blood.

The persistent headache and the blood suggested he might have injured his head. He turned to the mirror, where a scholarly figure with black hair and brown eyes stared back. As he leaned closer, he saw a grotesque wound on his temple, surrounded by burn marks and slowly oozing brain matter.

This was Klein Moretti, the new him. The situation was surreal, yet the pain was all too real.
