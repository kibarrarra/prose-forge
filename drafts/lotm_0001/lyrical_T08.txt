Chapter 1: Crimson

Agony! 

Unbearable agony! 

My head pulses with a pain so intense it feels as though someone has taken a pole and struck me repeatedly. No, more viciously, it feels like a sharp instrument has pierced through my temples and is twisting with malicious intent!

In the depths of an extravagant, shimmering dreamscape, Zhou Mingrui lies, his consciousness snagged by an unusual throbbing that resounds through his entire being. Attempting to rouse himself, to shift, to sit upright, he discovers his limbs unresponsive, as if he’s been ensnared by invisible chains.

It seems I’m still dreaming, he muses, a thought born of familiarity with such experiences. This might be one of those dreams where I think I’m awake, yet I remain adrift in slumber...

Zhou Mingrui, well-versed in the art of navigating dreams, strives to harness his focus, to break free from the bonds of this shadowy confusion. But within this ethereal realm, his willpower is as insubstantial as vapor, his thoughts eluding his grasp as they scatter like leaves in the wind.

Why this sudden, devastating headache in the dead of night? The pain is excruciating! Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? Damn, I can’t be dying so young!

He forces himself to awaken. Now!

Wait, does it hurt less now? Yet it feels as though a dull blade is slicing through my mind...

Sleep is futile now. How will I face work tomorrow? 

Why does work even cross my mind amidst this torment? No, this headache demands a respite. Who cares if my boss grumbles?

On the bright side, perhaps I’ll get some much-needed time for myself. Hehe, every cloud has its silver lining.

As the throbbing pain engulfs Zhou Mingrui, he gathers strength, finally managing to stir his back and open his eyes. At long last, he emerges from his reverie.

His vision wavers before settling, veiled in a delicate crimson hue. Before him lies a robust wooden desk, atop which rests an open notebook with pages as coarse and yellowed as old parchment. The title glows with deep black letters, unfamiliar and strange.

To the notebook's left, a neat pile of eight books stands in orderly array. The adjacent wall features grayish-white pipes, intricately connected to a lamp.

The lamp exudes an elegance echoing bygone Western styles. It’s about half the size of an adult’s head, with an interior of transparent glass encased in a grid of black metal.

Beneath this lamp, an ink bottle rests, bathed in a soft red glow. Its surface bears the faint, blurred etching of an angel.

A dark pen lies beside the notebook, its body rounded and smooth. Its tip gleams faintly, while its cap rests near a brass revolver.

A gun? A revolver? Zhou Mingrui is caught off guard, the unfamiliar scene starkly contrasting with his own room.

Befuddled and disoriented, he notices the desk, the notebook, the ink, and the revolver, all cloaked in a layer of crimson, a gift of the window’s light.

Involuntarily, his gaze shifts upward.

High in the sky, a crimson moon hangs suspended amid a ‘black velvet curtain,’ silent in its luminous glow.

This... A chill dances along Zhou Mingrui’s spine. He rises abruptly, yet before he can fully stand, his head throbs with renewed fervor. He collapses back into the sturdy wooden chair, the impact reverberating through him.

The pain scarcely registers. Determined, Zhou Mingrui pushes himself upright once more, spinning around to take stock of his surroundings.

The room is modest in size, with a brown door on either side. Across from him is a low wooden bed.

Between the bed and one door stands a cabinet, its two doors yawning open above five drawers.

To the cabinet’s side, another grayish-white pipe runs along the wall, connecting to a strange mechanical device exposing gears and bearings.

In the room's far corner, near the table, sit coal stove-like objects, along with soup pots, iron pots, and various kitchen implements.

Opposite the other door stands a dressing mirror, marred by two cracks. Its base is wooden, adorned with simple patterns.

Zhou Mingrui’s gaze lands on his reflection—his current self.

Black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, an average build, features unremarkable yet possessing a certain depth...

This... Zhou Mingrui inhales sharply, a tide of helpless, bewildered speculation washing over him.

The ancient European revolver and the enigmatic crimson moon starkly divergent from Earth’s could signify only one thing:

Did I transmigrate? Zhou Mingrui’s mouth hangs slightly open in disbelief.

A lifelong devourer of web novels, he often indulged in such fantasies. Yet standing in the midst of one, he struggles to reconcile with this unexpected twist in his reality.

Is this what it means to love fantasy? Despite himself, Zhou Mingrui curses his predicament while striving to glean a silver lining from the adversity.

Were it not for the persistent headache keeping his thoughts clear and vigilant, he might have dismissed it all as a dream.

Calm down, calm down, calm down... He breathes deeply, endeavoring to quiet his panic.

As his body and mind settle, memories surge within him, slowly taking form.

Klein Moretti, citizen of the Northern Continent’s Loen Kingdom, Awwa County, City of Tingen. A recent graduate in History from Khoy University...

His father, an Imperial Army sergeant, perished in a colonial skirmish on the Southern Continent. The bereavement allowance afforded Klein the chance to attend a private language school, laying the groundwork for university admission...

His mother, a devoted follower of the Evernight Goddess, passed the year Klein entered Khoy University...

He has an elder brother and a younger sister, with whom he shares a modest two-bedroom apartment...

The family’s means are sparse, their situation borderline precarious. Currently, they rely on his elder brother’s income as a clerk at an import-export firm...

As a history graduate, Klein possesses knowledge of the ancient Feysac language—reputedly the root of all Northern Continent languages—as well as Hermes, prevalent in ancient tombs and texts pertaining to sacrificial and prayer rituals...

Hermes language? Zhou Mingrui’s curiosity piques, and he instinctively massages his throbbing temples. He casts his eyes towards the open notebook on the table. Slowly, the alien text morphs into the familiar, emerging into comprehensible words.

The dark ink spells out:

"Everyone will die, including me."

A sharp intake of breath escapes Zhou Mingrui, a chill racing through him. Instinctively, he leans back, endeavoring to distance himself from the notebook and its ominous message.

Teetering, he nearly collapses, but his hands fly out to grip the table’s edge. The air around him vibrates with dissonance, reminiscent of ghost stories whispered in childhood shadows.

Shaking his head, dismissing the sensation as a figment of imagination, Zhou Mingrui steadies himself, dragging his gaze from the notebook as he struggles to breathe.

His eyes fall upon the gleaming brass revolver. A question surfaces unbidden:

How did Klein’s family afford a revolver?

Zhou Mingrui’s brow furrows in consternation.

As he contemplates, his gaze alights on a deep red handprint near the table. Its hue richer than moonlight, more vivid than the crimson glow.

A bloody handprint?

His right hand, gripping the table’s edge, is flipped over, revealing a palm stained with blood.

Simultaneously, the persistent pain in his head continues its dull beat, relentless in its persistence.

Did I injure my head?

Speculating, Zhou Mingrui turns toward the cracked dressing mirror.

Approaching, the reflection of a medium-built, black-haired man with brown eyes appears, exuding an air of scholarship.

Is this me now? Klein Moretti?

Zhou Mingrui pauses, the dim lighting obscuring his view. He steps closer, halting just shy of the mirror’s surface.

In the crimson-tinged moonlight, he tilts his head, inspecting his temple.

The mirror reveals a grotesque wound, its edges singed and raw. Blood frames the gash, with grayish-white matter faintly pulsating within.
