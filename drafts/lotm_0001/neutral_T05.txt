Chapter 1: Crimson

The agony was unbearable.

Zhou Mingrui's head throbbed with an intensity that felt like a merciless assault. It was as though a sharp object had pierced through his temples and twisted viciously. In his deep slumber, he tried to move, to sit up, but found himself paralyzed, as if his body was no longer his to command.

Am I still dreaming? he wondered, grappling with the sensation of being trapped in a vivid nightmare. He had experienced such dreams before, where he believed he was awake only to realize he was still asleep. Desperately, he tried to focus, willing himself to break free from the oppressive darkness.

But his thoughts drifted like mist, elusive and uncontrollable. Why this sudden, excruciating headache? Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? Am I going to die young? I need to wake up!

Gradually, the pain subsided, though it lingered like a blunt knife slicing through his mind. Sleep was impossible now, and he fretted about work the next day. But then, perhaps this headache was a blessing in disguise—a legitimate reason to take time off and escape his manager's complaints.

As the throbbing receded, Zhou Mingrui gathered enough strength to move. His eyes fluttered open, revealing a blurred vision cloaked in crimson. Before him stood a study desk, crafted from sturdy wood. An open notebook lay in the center, its pages yellowed and coarse, the title scrawled in strange, dark letters.

To the left, a neat stack of books, about eight in number, sat beside the wall, which was lined with grayish-white pipes and adorned with wall lamps. The lamps were styled in a classical Western manner, with transparent glass encased in black metal grids.

Beneath the lamp, a black ink bottle glowed faintly red, its surface embossed with an angelic pattern. In front of the ink bottle, beside the notebook, lay a dark pen and a brass revolver.

A revolver? Zhou Mingrui was taken aback. None of these items belonged to him, nor did this room resemble his own. Bewildered, he noticed the crimson veil that enveloped everything, cast by the light filtering through the window.

Instinctively, he looked up. A crimson moon hung silently in the sky, set against a backdrop as dark as a velvet curtain.

The sight filled him with dread. He stood abruptly, but the movement sent a jolt of pain through his head, causing him to collapse back into the wooden chair.

Ignoring the pain, Zhou Mingrui stood once more, propping himself up to survey his surroundings. The room was modest, with a brown door on each side. Opposite him, a low wooden bed rested against the wall.

Between the bed and the left door stood an open cabinet with five drawers beneath it. A strange mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings was affixed to the wall beside it.

In the room's corner, near the table, were items resembling coal stoves, along with pots and kitchen utensils. Across from the right door was a cracked dressing mirror with a simple wooden frame.

As his gaze swept the room, Zhou Mingrui caught his reflection in the mirror—the current him.

Black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, and an average build with nondescript features. This can't be... Zhou Mingrui inhaled sharply, his mind racing with confusion.

The revolver, the crimson moon—these were not of his world. Could he have transmigrated?

He had read countless web novels and often fantasized about such scenarios, but now that he faced the reality, acceptance was elusive. Calm down, calm down, calm down... He repeated to himself, taking deep breaths to quell his panic.

As he calmed, memories began to surface, slowly piecing together a new identity.

Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Northern Continent's Loen Kingdom, in Awwa County, City of Tingen. A recent graduate from Khoy University's Department of History...

His father, a sergeant in the Imperial Army, had died in a colonial conflict. The bereavement allowance allowed Klein to attend a private language school and later, university.

His mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, had passed away the year he entered Khoy University. He had an elder brother and a younger sister, and they lived together in a modest two-bedroom apartment.

Their financial situation was precarious, relying solely on his elder brother's clerk job at an import-export company. Klein, a history graduate, was proficient in the ancient Feysac language and the Hermes language, often found in ancient texts and rituals.

Hermes language? Zhou Mingrui's curiosity piqued as he rubbed his temples, casting his gaze at the notebook. The strange text on its yellowed pages morphed into something familiar, then readable.

It was written in Hermes language: "Everyone will die, including me."

The words sent a shiver down his spine. He recoiled instinctively, nearly losing his balance, but managed to steady himself by gripping the table's edge. The air felt charged, as though whispers echoed around him, reminiscent of childhood ghost stories.

Shaking his head, Zhou Mingrui dismissed it as an illusion. He shifted his focus from the notebook, breathing heavily.

His eyes fell on the brass revolver. How could Klein's family afford such a weapon?

Puzzled, Zhou Mingrui noticed a red handprint on the table, darker than the moonlight. It was a bloody handprint.

Startled, he flipped his right hand, revealing it was stained with blood. The persistent headache made him suspect an injury.

Did I injure my head? Zhou Mingrui wondered, turning towards the cracked mirror.

Approaching cautiously, he examined his reflection. The black-haired figure with brown eyes and a scholarly demeanor was him—Klein Moretti.

In the dim light, he scrutinized the corner of his forehead. The mirror reflected a grotesque wound, its edges burnt. Blood stained the surrounding skin, and within, grayish-white brain matter pulsed slowly.

This revelation left Zhou Mingrui reeling, grappling with the reality of his new existence and the mystery of his injury.
