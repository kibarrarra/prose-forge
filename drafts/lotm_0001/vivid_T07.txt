**Chapter 1: Crimson**

The agony was indescribable, a cacophony of pain that throbbed and pulsed with relentless intensity.

Zhou Mingrui's consciousness was ensnared in a vivid, surreal tableau—a riot of colors and murmurs swirling chaotically around him. His head felt as though it was being repeatedly struck by an unseen force, each blow a sharp lance of torment spearing through his temples and twisting viciously.

In the depths of his stupor, Zhou Mingrui struggled to orient himself, to turn or sit up, but his limbs were inert, as if tethered by invisible chains.

This isn’t real, he reasoned, still trapped in the dreamscape. He had experienced such vivid dreams before, where waking felt like another layer of slumber.

Desperately, he tried to marshal his will, focusing all his energy on breaking free from this dark, nebulous prison of unconsciousness. Yet, the harder he fought, the more elusive his thoughts became, slipping away like smoke through his fingers.

Why this sudden, excruciating headache in the dead of night?

The pain was relentless, a brutal symphony pounding in his skull. Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? Was this it—a premature end?

His resolve crystallized. He had to wake up, now!

The pain's grip gradually slackened, though a dull, persistent ache remained, like a blunt blade scraping across his mind. Sleep was impossible. How would he manage work tomorrow?

Why am I worrying about work? Zhou Mingrui chided himself. This was an authentic, incapacitating headache. He could surely take a day off, manager’s complaints be damned. The thought brought a wry, fleeting smile to his lips.

Slowly, the throbbing subsided enough for him to muster the strength to move. He blinked open his eyes, and the dream shattered.

His vision swam into focus, piercing through a haze of crimson. Before him was a stout, wooden study desk. At its center lay an open notebook, its pages coarse and yellowed, the title inscribed in stark, unfamiliar script.

To the notebook's left, a stack of books—eight in total—stood neatly arranged. The wall beside them was adorned with grayish-white pipes, from which hung a solitary wall lamp.

The lamp was a piece of Western antiquity, its glass interior encased by a grid of black metal, casting a soft glow. 

Beneath this light, a bottle of ink stood shrouded in a pale red aura, its embossed surface depicting a blurred angelic figure.

Adjacent to the ink bottle, a dark pen rested, its circular form gleaming subtly. Beside it lay a brass revolver, its presence jarringly out of place.

A revolver? Zhou Mingrui’s heart jolted. The objects around him—this desk, these strange items—were foreign, utterly unlike his own room.

Bewildered, he noted how everything was bathed in a layer of crimson light, streaming through the window.

His eyes were drawn upwards.

Suspended in the velvet darkness of the sky was a crimson moon, silent and ominous.

The sight sent a shiver down his spine, and he stood abruptly, only for the pain to flare, his legs giving way as he collapsed back into the chair.

Despite the pain, determination propelled him to his feet again. He turned, frantically taking in his surroundings.

The room was modest, bordered by a brown door on each side. Against the opposite wall, a low wooden bed lay waiting.

A cabinet stood between the bed and left door, its doors ajar, beneath which were five drawers. 

To its side, another pipe snaked along the wall, connected to a peculiar mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings exposed.

In the room's corner, a coal stove sat alongside pots and utensils. Nearby, a dressing mirror stood cracked, its wooden base plain yet functional.

Zhou Mingrui's reflection caught his eye—black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt. His features were thin, unremarkable, yet undeniably his.

This... Zhou Mingrui inhaled sharply. A torrent of confused possibilities surged through his mind.

The revolver, the crimson moon—these were signs of an entirely different world.

Could I have transmigrated? His mouth fell open slightly.

He had read countless tales of such occurrences, even fantasized about them. Yet now, finding himself in one such story, disbelief gnawed at him.

If not for the persistent ache in his head, he might have dismissed it all as a dream.

Calm down, calm down... With deep, measured breaths, he quelled the rising tide of panic.

As he steadied himself, memories began to unfurl within his mind, unfamiliar yet undeniably his.

Klein Moretti—resident of Loen Kingdom, Awwa County, City of Tingen. A recent history graduate from Khoy University...

His father, a sergeant in the Imperial Army, had perished in a colonial skirmish, leaving behind a bereavement allowance that funded Klein's education.

His mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, had passed away the year Klein entered Khoy University.

He had an elder brother and a younger sister, all living together in a modest two-bedroom apartment.

The family's financial situation was precarious, relying solely on the income of his brother, a clerk at an import-export company.

As a history student, Klein had learned the ancient Feysac language, considered the root of all tongues in the Northern Continent, alongside the Hermes language, prevalent in ancient texts and rituals...

Hermes language? Zhou Mingrui’s interest piqued. He rubbed his temples and glanced at the open notebook, the text shifting from foreign to familiar, finally resolving into something readable.

In stark Hermes script, the ink declared:

"Everyone will die, including me."

The words struck him like a physical blow, sending him reeling back. Instinctively, he sought to distance himself from the ominous message.

His movements clumsy, he nearly toppled over, clutching the table’s edge to steady himself. The air seemed to vibrate with a low, unsettling hum, reminiscent of childhood tales whispered in the dark.

With a shake of his head, he dismissed it as illusion. Regaining his composure, he shifted his gaze from the notebook, his breathing ragged.

His eyes fell on the brass revolver, a new question arising.

How could Klein’s family afford such a weapon?

Zhou Mingrui frowned, pondering this anomaly.

Amidst his musings, a deep red handprint caught his attention, etched into the table’s surface. Darker than the moonlight, denser than the crimson glow.

A bloody handprint.

In a reflexive motion, Zhou Mingrui flipped his right hand. His palm and fingers were slick with blood.

Simultaneously, the throbbing in his head persisted, relentless though diminished.

Did I injure my head?

He speculated, approaching the cracked dressing mirror.

Steps away, the reflection of a medium-built, scholarly figure with brown eyes and black hair came into focus.

Is this the present me? Klein Moretti?

Zhou Mingrui paused, the dim light obscuring details. He inched closer until he was nearly nose-to-nose with the glass.

Under the moon's crimson veil, he examined his temple.

The mirror revealed a grotesque wound, its edges charred, blood staining the skin. Within the wound, grayish matter pulsed slowly, a sight both surreal and horrifying.
