    "content": "The morning sun cast long shadows across the city as Alex made her way through the crowded marketplace. She had been in this situation countless times before - trying to find a rare artifact while avoiding unwanted attention.\n\nToday's target was supposed to be simple: a small brass compass that once belonged to a legendary explorer. The seller had contacted her through the usual channels, and everything seemed straightforward. Yet something felt off about this particular job.\n\n\"Five silver for a bundle!\" a merchant called out as she passed. Alex barely registered his voice among the cacophony of the market. Her focus was entirely on the small stall at the far end, where an old woman sat behind a table covered with trinkets and oddities.\n\nAs she approached, the old woman looked up and smiled, revealing a row of surprisingly white teeth. \"I've been expecting you,\" she said.\n\nAlex raised an eyebrow. \"People usually say that after I introduce myself.\"\n\n\"No need for introductions when fate brings two people together,\" the woman replied. She reached beneath the table and produced a small wooden box. \"I believe this is what you seek.\"\n\nThe box was unassuming, made of dark wood with a simple latch. No markings, no ornate carvings - nothing to suggest it contained anything of value.\n\n\"May I?\" Alex asked, reaching for the box.\n\nThe woman nodded. \"Of course. But remember, child, some treasures carry their own burdens.\"\n\nWith careful fingers, Alex unlatched the box and opened it. Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, lay the compass. Its brass casing was tarnished with age, but the intricate engravings were still visible - constellations and strange symbols that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles.\n\n\"It's authentic,\" she whispered, more to herself than to the old woman.\n\n\"Did you expect otherwise?\" The woman chuckled. \"Three hundred gold, as agreed.\"\n\nAlex closed the box and looked up sharply. \"The price was two hundred.\"\n\n\"Was it?\" The woman's eyes glinted. \"Perhaps my memory fails me in my old age. But I recall quite clearly that special items command special prices.\"\n\nSomething in the woman's tone made Alex uneasy. She glanced around the marketplace, suddenly aware of several pairs of eyes watching their exchange. This was definitely not going according to plan.\n\n\"Two fifty,\" Alex countered, keeping her voice low. \"And we conclude our business quickly.\"\n\nThe old woman considered this for a moment, then nodded. \"A fair compromise. You're wiser than many who've sought this compass before.\"\n\nAs Alex counted out the coins, the woman leaned forward. \"A word of caution, seeker. The compass doesn't just find locations - it reveals paths. Choose yours wisely.\"\n\nBefore Alex could ask what she meant, the woman had swept the coins into a pouch and turned to another customer. Transaction complete.\n\nWith the box tucked securely inside her jacket, Alex made her way back through the market. The weight of the compass seemed to grow with each step, and the old woman's warning echoed in her mind.\n\nChoose your path wisely. As if she had a choice anymore."
