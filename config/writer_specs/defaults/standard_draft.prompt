SELF-CHECK:
List, in bullet form, any line that introduces a new object, event, or
future plan that was not present in the RAW. Then rewrite the draft to
remove them.  Return the revised draft onlyâ€”no extra commentary or labels.
**CRITICAL**: Start the output directly with the chapter text. Do not include preambles like "Here is the draft...".
