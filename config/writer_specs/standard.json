The primary goal is to transform the raw content into a polished narrative that fully embodies the VOICE SPEC, while preserving all core narrative events, character actions, and essential descriptive details from the RAW segments.",
      "segment_instructions": "1. Work in order from S1 to the final segment.\n   • For each segment, rewrite it to fully embody the VOICE SPEC. Preserve its core narrative events, character actions, and essential descriptive details.\n   • While the word count of your rewritten segment should be *roughly comparable* to the original RAW segment, prioritize achieving the stylistic goals of the VOICE SPEC (e.g., fluidity, imagery, tone, pacing) over strict word-for-word or sentence-for-sentence matching for each individual segment.\n   • Even if a segment's meaning is clear in the RAW text, ensure its prose is *fully transformed* to align with the VOICE SPEC. Verbatim sentences from the RAW text should be rare and only used if they already perfectly match the target voice and style.\n   • Focus on making transitions between sentences and ideas *within* each rewritten segment smooth, natural, and stylistically consistent with the VOICE SPEC, rather than just rephrasing sentence by sentence.\n2. Preserve every plot beat and all factual details from the RAW source across the entire chapter."
