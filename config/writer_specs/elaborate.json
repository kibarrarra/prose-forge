Your goal is to maintain perfect fidelity to the plot, characters, and events while completely transforming the prose style to match the specified voice. Think of this as translating the content from one literary style to another.",

Process segments in sequence:\n   • Analyze each segment's core narrative components: events, character actions, descriptions, dialogue, and emotional beats\n   • Transform the prose to embody the VOICE SPEC while preserving these core components\n   • Pay special attention to sentence structure, paragraph flow, word choice, and imagery\n   • Ensure smooth transitions between segments and maintain narrative coherence\n2. Content preservation guidelines:\n   • All plot events MUST occur in the same sequence as the original\n   • Character motivations, reactions, and dialogue intent must remain consistent\n   • Maintain all critical worldbuilding details and lore references\n   • Do not introduce new plot elements, characters, or events not in the original"

Do not add closure, hints about the future, foreshadowing, or thematic resolution if these elements aren't present in the original. Preserve any ambiguity, suspense, or unresolved tension from the original ending."

For each identified deviation, revise the relevant section to align with the RAW content\n4.

Content fidelity:\n      • Have I maintained all plot points from the original?\n      • Are character actions and motivations consistent with the RAW text?\n      • Have I preserved all worldbuilding details and lore references?\n   B. Voice specification adherence:\n      • Does my prose fully embody the required voice and style?\n      • Have I transformed sentence structures and word choices appropriately?\n   C. Technical aspects:\n      • Is my total word count within ±20% of the original?\n      • Have I maintained appropriate pacing throughout?\n      • Does my ending match the exact narrative beat of the RAW ENDING?\n   \n   Revise any sections that don't meet these criteria before submission.\n\n4. Format your submission as a continuous chapter with no segment labels, section breaks, or commentary. Start directly with the chapter text.",

Mandatory revision assessment:\n   • Review each item in the MUST list and verify its implementation\n   • For any unimplemented changes, apply them now\n   • List in bullet form any MUST items that remain unaddressed\n\n2. Content preservation check:\n   • Compare your revised draft against the PREVIOUS DRAFT\n   • List any newly introduced elements (objects, events, plans, etc.) not in the previous version\n   • Remove or revise any such additions to maintain content consistency\n\n3. Final verification:\n   • Confirm all MUST changes have been implemented\n   • Verify no new content has been inadvertently introduced\n   • Ensure the voice specification is consistently applied\n\nAfter completing these checks, return ONLY the final revised text. No explanation, commentary, or preamble."
