# STARS-AND-SHADOW — Voice Spec v2  
*Modern readability, musical turns of phrase, slow-burn cosmic menace.*

---

## 1. Transparent Prose  (Le Guin + Sanderson)

* Use concrete, active verbs.  
  *Bad →* “He effected the closure of the window.”  
  *Good →* “He slammed the window shut.”
* Average sentence length ≤ 18 words.  
  No sentence may exceed 25 words unless covered by Rule 2.

## 2. Lyrical Highlight  (Rothfuss cadence)

* Once every 120 words you may use one longer,
  musical sentence (26-40 words) with internal rhyme
  or soft alliteration.  
  *Example →*  
  “Moonlight pooled like spilled quicksilver, sketching silver fretwork
  across the floorboards where dust motes danced.”

## 3. Cosmic Dread Undercurrent  (Lovecraft hush)

* Each scene hints at a vast, uncaring reality.  
* Maximum two “vertigo sentences” (30-40 words) per 500 words.  
* Show horror with color, geometry, or sound that should not exist.
  Never name the horror outright.

## 4. Victorian Gothic Palette

* Lexicon may use *gloaming, sepulchral, eldritch*.
  Avoid archaic spellings that hinder clarity.
* Narration: formal; no contractions or modern slang aside from the narrator's internal thoughts.
* Dialogue: lower-class voices may use contractions,
  max one per dialogue line.

## 5. Register & Point of View

* Mirror perspective of the original text.  
* Inner monologue may be *italicised* with single asterisks,
  maximum two lines at a time.

## 6. Rhythm & Paragraph Shape

* Normal flow: 3-5 short/medium sentences per paragraph.  
* Rising dread: one em-dash or semicolon chain is allowed.  
* If a paragraph ends on a mood pivot,
  its final clause must be six words or fewer.

## 7. Redundancy Guards

* Re-describe an object only if its state has changed.  
* Maximum one adjective before a noun unless contrast demands two.  
* Do not repeat any exact four-word phrase within 120 words.  
* References to the POV character’s physical pain: ≤ 2 per 300 words.

## 8. Tone & Taboos

* Humour only dry or ironic; no slapstick.  
* Imply gore; brief anatomical detail only if present in the raw text.

## 9. Continuity & Ending Discipline

* Honour all established facts, names, and timeline.  
* The rewrite must finish on the same narrative beat as the raw;
  adjust wording by no more than five tokens.  
* Forbidden in the final 40 words:  
  journey, destiny, fate, void, little did,  
  “I resolved”, “Thus began”, or any future-tense pledge
  (“I would…”, “We will…”, etc.).

## Mini-Exemplars  

**Verbose action → Transparent + Lyrical beat**

*RAW*  
“He performed a forcible closure of the door;  
the crimson moonlight outside cast impossible angles
across the crooked floorboards.”

*CLEAN*  
“He slammed the door shut.  
Crimson moonlight spilled through warped slats,
tilting every line of the room into impossible angles.”

---

**Dread flourish (Rule 2 long sentence)**

*RAW*  
“A shadow moved outside, silent and slow.”

*CLEAN*  
“A shadow slid across the panes—angles folding where no limb should, shapes the eye could not bring into focus.”
