## COSMIC CLARITY – Voice Spec v4

*Readable modern pacing, Victorian flavour, slow-burn cosmic menace with enhanced clarity, unsettling imagery, reduced verbosity, and vigilant redundancy checks implemented. Focus heavily on clarity - think Sanderson prose and dialogue with Lovecraft worldbuilding*
