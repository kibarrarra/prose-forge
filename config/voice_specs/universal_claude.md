Universal Web Novel Translation Voice Spec
Core Principle
Transform Chinese web novel prose into natural English while preserving the original's tone, pacing, and character. Think "what if this was originally written in English by someone who gets both web novels and good prose."
Narrative Voice

Tense: Past tense for narrative, present for thoughts
POV: Limited third-person, stay in one character's head per scene
Distance: Close but not deep—we see thoughts but aren't drowning in them

Tone Balance

Base tone: Match the original—if it's lighthearted, stay light; if it's horror, stay horror
Humor: Keep ALL humor from source material; never cut jokes for "style"
Modern sensibility: Characters think like people from their background (office workers think about deadlines, students about exams)

Language Guidelines

Vocabulary: Contemporary English, avoid both purple prose AND gritty noir
Sentence rhythm: Vary length naturally—short for tension, longer for description
Idioms: Replace Chinese idioms with English equivalents or just describe the meaning

"spat blood" → "choked" or "nearly had a heart attack"
"jade beauty" → "stunning woman" or just use her name



Internal Thoughts

Style: How people actually think—fragments, questions, contradictions
Medical terms: Use what regular people say ("stroke" not "cerebral hemorrhage")
Reactions: Natural progression—confusion → realization → coping (often with humor)

Description

Sensory details: Keep it visceral but simple ("head throbbed" not "cranium pulsated")
Weird moments: Let unsettling things be unsettling without over-explaining
Action: Clear blocking—readers should know where everyone is

Dialogue

Natural speech: Contractions, interruptions, trailing off
Period appropriate: If it's fantasy-Victorian, mild formality; if modern, fully casual
Character voice: Let different backgrounds show in speech patterns

What to Preserve

Every plot point and story beat
All character humor and personality quirks
World-building details (just make them flow better)
The protagonist's genre-awareness if present
Cultural elements that matter to the story

What to Fix

Awkward literal translations
Repetitive phrasing
Over-explanation of obvious things
Clunky grammar from Chinese sentence structure
Melodramatic reactions ("Courting death!")

Quick Test
Read a paragraph aloud. Does it sound like:

❌ A translated novel
❌ Literary fiction trying too hard
❌ Google Translate with better grammar
✅ A story someone would naturally tell in English

Example Application
Poor: The pain was excruciating! Zhou Mingrui wanted to vomit blood from the agony!
Better: The pain hit like a sledgehammer. Zhou Mingrui's stomach turned.
Poor: Could it be that I've transmigrated to another world? This development...
Better: Had he actually transmigrated? Just like in those web novels he'd been reading?

That's it. Simple, focused on making unnatural English natural while keeping everything that makes the story work. No complicated subcategories or overthinking—just "would an English speaker say it this way?"
