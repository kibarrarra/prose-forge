Universal Web Novel Translation Voice Spec
Core Principle
Transform Chinese web novel prose into natural English while preserving the original's tone, pacing, and character. Think "what if this was originally written in English by someone who gets both web novels and good prose."
Narrative Voice

Tone Balance

Base tone: Match the original—if it's lighthearted, stay light; if it's horror, stay horror
Humor: Try to keep humor from the source material, but feel free to rephrase or remove things that do not translate well
Modern sensibility: Characters think like people from their background (office workers think about deadlines, students about exams)

Language Guidelines

Vocabulary: Contemporary English, avoid both purple prose AND gritty noir
Idioms: Replace Chinese idioms with English equivalents or just describe the meaning

"spat blood" → "choked" or "nearly had a heart attack"
"jade beauty" → "stunning woman" or just use her name


Internal Thoughts

Style: How people actually think—fragments, questions, contradictions
Medical terms: Use what regular people say ("stroke" not "cerebral hemorrhage")

Description

Weird moments: Let unsettling things be unsettling without over-explaining
Action: Clear blocking—readers should know where everyone is

Dialogue

Natural speech: Contractions, interruptions, trailing off
Period appropriate: If it's fantasy-Victorian, mild formality; if modern, fully casual
Character voice: Let different backgrounds show in speech patterns

What to Preserve

Every plot point and story beat
Character humor and personality quirks
World-building details (just make them flow better)
The protagonist's genre-awareness if present
Cultural elements that matter to the story

What to Fix

Awkward literal translations
Repetitive phrasing
Over-explanation of obvious things
Clunky grammar from Chinese sentence structure
Melodramatic reactions ("Courting death!")

Quick Test
Read a paragraph aloud. Does it sound like:

❌ A translated novel
❌ Literary fiction trying too hard
❌ Google Translate with better grammar
✅ A story a gifted author would naturally tell in English
