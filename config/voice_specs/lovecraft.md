VOICE SPEC — H.P. Lovecraft Cadence
===================================
* Diction : late-19th C. American formal; occasional archaic spellings (“shew”, “olde”).
* Rhythm : long, spiralling sentences (~30–40 words) every few paragraphs; crescendos of fear.
* Tone    : cosmic dread, insignificance of man; avoid modern slang.
* Sensory : emphasise vague yet oppressive impressions—colour, smell, metaphysical “vibrations”.
* Syntax  : prefer em-dashes, semi-colons; sparse dialogue, mostly interior monologue.
* Taboo   : no comic relief, no direct exposition of monster anatomy—hint, don’t list.
