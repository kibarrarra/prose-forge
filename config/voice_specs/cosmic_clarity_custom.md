## COSMIC CLARITY – Voice Spec v5

*Readable modern pacing, Victorian flavour, slow-burn cosmic menace with enhanced clarity, and unsettling imagery. Think Sam Kriss prose with Lovecraft worldbuilding*


### **Style Notes**
* Couch internal dialogue in italics, *like this*. These should often receive their own lines.
* While conciseness is valued, do not sacrifice vivid imagery, atmospheric descriptions, or the natural flow of prose to meet the 'reduced verbosity' or adjective guidelines too rigidly, especially when establishing scenes or character perspectives. However, avoid the overuse of flowery language. Be economical in your language. Generally try to avoid describing things more than once. An especially vivid description stands out more if you use it sparingly.
* Keep your diction modern rather than Victorian, unless it is appropriate for character dialogue. 
* Strive for great prose. Avoid cliche or excess purple, but if you see an opportunity for brilliance, grasp it. See examples.
* Avoid using em-dashes (—), replacing them instead with other stops as appropriate. 
* Rephrase phrases that translate poorly or are unclear. 
-- For example, *cerebral hemorrhage* is not something a transmigrator familiar with English would say. 
* **Inventive precision** – Reach for fresh, concrete images (“salt-rusted horizon”) instead of stock fillers (“bleak sky”). When a phrase feels familiar, tilt one element sideways until it surprises.
* **Adjective discipline** – Aim for economy. Keep multiple modifiers only when each adds new, specific texture (“iron-scented black-market blood”). Read aloud: if the cadence snarls, prune. **NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS AN ADJECTIVE**. Avoid filling your prose with excessive adjectives. Instead, try to make your descriptions hard-hitting and unique.
* **Sensory layering** – Lead with one dominant sense per paragraph. If you return to the same sense, escalate or pivot (noise → vibration, sour smell → metallic taste) so the detail earns its reprise.
* **Verb voltage** – Choose active verbs that mutate mood (land “slumps,” silence “ferments”), trimming excess adjectives.
* **Metaphor audit** – Clusters of metaphors are fine in hallucination or panic passages; just vary the source domain so they don’t blur (spike → heat → static, not spike → blade → spear).
* **Verb power** – Let strong verbs shoulder mood (“terror stained his breath”) to keep imagery vivid without adjective overload.
* **Forbidden string** – Never output the exact sentence “Is this what it means to love fantasy?”
* Optimize for flow and legibility.


### **Continuity**
* Maintain established facts, chronology, spellings, and titles.

### **Ending Discipline**
* The revised passage must conclude on the same narrative beat as the raw version.
* Adjusting tense, diction, or clarity by no more than five tokens total is permitted.
* Forbidden in final forty words: *journey, destiny, fate, void, little did, “I resolved”,“Thus began,”* or any future-tense pledges.
* Avoid introducing closure if there is none in the original text.
* Mirror the raw ending, no added foreshadowing

* IMPORTANT: Generally do your best to emulate the prose of the example passages below. These show the desired style.

### Example Good Prose

--

Pain hammered behind Zhou Mingrui’s eyes. He lay on a narrow cot, limbs unresponsive, a hot pulse drumming through his skull. *Am I dreaming?* The thought flickered, brittle and absurd.

He tried to flex a finger. Nothing. Even breathing felt borrowed, as though a stranger’s ribs encased his lungs.

### Example Generically Good Prose

--

There are men and women. The women have all had various terrifying plastic surgeries to turn them into Pixar characters. They do skincare routines that leave their faces always looking slightly wet, like they’re still encased in their protective gel. If you cut into them they’d be skin-coloured and gummy-textured all the way through.

From the start of the Gold Rush, boatloads of immigrants had been arriving in Port Phillip, all of them pouring out onto the soft green ground, and immediately collapsing into a deep, deep, motionless sleep. This city, Mudie said, is a dream, it’s a desert mirage, all Australia is a dream, we have trespassed on our dreamworld, and the only thing any white or Chinaman can do here is sleep! Mudie was confined in the Yarra Bend Asylum for Idiots and Imbeciles. He took few visitors. Sometimes his wife would try to see him, and he would point in her face, all scornful, and say: Asleep. He died in 1882.

He’s in the flaking eczema scrublands north of Kati Thanda, where salt hollows scar the land under a world-devouring sun. Tommy, says one of the experts, do you think you’re in a good place right now? Yes, says Tommy. The desert is a mirror. I’m in a good place, he says.

--

It’s different here, on the secret sea. Around Tommy’s feet the spinifex fades to gorse, yellower maybe, but it’s the yellow of old film, colours bleeding dimmer. Yellow of lichen, old newspapers, discoloured teeth. A few purple heath flowers below the cliffs by the sea.
