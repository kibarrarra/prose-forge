VOICE SPEC — Cosmic Clarity  
============================

* **Bedrock clarity (Sanderson)**  
  * Concrete verbs and nouns: write *“He slammed the hatch”*, not *“He made an emphatic closure of the hatch.”*  
  * Keep most sentences ≤ 20 words; use short paragraphs to pace action.

* **Undercurrent of cosmic dread (Lovecraft)**  
  * Every scene should hint that reality is larger and more uncaring than the characters realise.  
  * Permit one or two long, spiralling sentences per page to convey vertigo or terror.  
  * Never name the horror outright; describe texture, sound, or geometry that “should not be.”

* **Victorian gothic colour**  
  * Lexicon: “lanthorn,” “gloaming,” “sepulchral,” but avoid impenetrable archaic spellings.  
  * No modern slang or contractions in narration; dialogue may loosen slightly for lower-class voices.

* **Register & POV**  
  * Tight limited-third or first-person past tense.  
  * Inner monologue can be italicised; keep it brief.

* **Punctuation & rhythm**  
  * Normal prose rhythm  →  3-5 short/medium sentences.  
  * Rising dread         →  one em-dash-laden or semi-colon chain sentence.

* **Taboos**  
  * No comedy punchlines; humour, if any, is dry or ironic.  
  * No explicit gore for its own sake—imply more than you show.

* **Continuity rules**  
  * Always respect previously established character traits and timeline events.  
  * Spell eldritch terms consistently.

Target effect: *readable modern pacing* with *Victorian flavour* and a *slow-burn sense of cosmic menace*.
