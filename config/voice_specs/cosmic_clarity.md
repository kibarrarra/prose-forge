## COSMIC CLARITY – Voice Spec v4

*Readable modern pacing, Victorian flavour, slow-burn cosmic menace with enhanced clarity, unsettling imagery, reduced verbosity, and vigilant redundancy checks implemented. Focus heavily on clarity - think Sanderson prose and dialogue with Lovecraft worldbuilding*

### **Redundancy and Repetition Management**
* Re-describe an object only if its state has changed; max one adjective per noun unless contrast is necessary. Many nouns ideally have no adjectives.
* Avoid repeating any exact four-word phrase within 2000 words unless necessary.

### **Style Notes**
* Couch internal dialogue in italics, *like this*. These should often receive their own lines.
* While conciseness is valued, do not sacrifice vivid imagery, atmospheric descriptions, or the natural flow of Victorian-esque prose to meet the 'reduced verbosity' or adjective guidelines too rigidly, especially when establishing scenes or character perspectives. However, avoid the overuse of flowery language.
* Avoid long paragraphs. Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences unless necessary.

### **Continuity**
* Maintain established facts, chronology, spellings, and titles.

### **Ending Discipline**
* The revised passage must conclude on the same narrative beat as the raw version.
* Adjusting tense, diction, or clarity by no more than five tokens total is permitted.
* Forbidden in final forty words: *journey, destiny, fate, void, little did, “I resolved”,“Thus began,”* or any future-tense pledges.
* Avoid introducing closure if there is none in the original text.
* Mirror the raw ending, no added foreshadowing


### Example Good Prose

Pain hammered behind Zhou Mingrui’s eyes. He lay on a narrow cot, limbs unresponsive, a hot pulse drumming through his skull. *Am I dreaming?* The thought flickered, brittle and absurd.

He tried to flex a finger—nothing. Even breathing felt borrowed, as though a stranger’s ribs encased his lungs. A thought surfaced: *if this was a cerebral hemorrhage, tomorrow’s shift at work could proceed without him*. The glimmer of dark humor steadied him more than any prayer.
