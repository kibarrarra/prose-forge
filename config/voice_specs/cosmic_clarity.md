## COSMIC CLARITY – Voice Spec v5

*Readable modern pacing with Victorian flavour, incorporating a slow-burn cosmic menace, enhanced clarity, greater depth of dread, reduced verbosity, and meticulous redundancy checks in effect.*

### **1. Clarity Enhancements**
* Replace vague nouns and verbs with precise terms; aim for concise, straightforward language.
* Average sentence length should be ≤ 17 words; limit to 25 only when necessary.

### **2. Enhanced Cosmic Dread**
* Utilize vivid visual and sensory details to evoke unsettling atmospheres in every scene.
* Apply metaphors that convey deep unease without overtly describing horror.

### **3. Victorian Gothic Detail**
* Use a lexicon appropriate for the era while ensuring it's accessible to contemporary readers.
* Character dialogue should reflect their background, with contractions used judiciously.

### **4. Rhythm and Structure**
* Standard flow of 3–5 varied sentence lengths per paragraph, integrating one em-dash or semicolon to build tension.
* Conclude paragraphs on mood pivots, with final clauses limited to ≤ 6 words.

### **5. Redundancy and Repetition Management**
* Introduce new descriptors if object or state changes and limit adjectives to one per noun unless contrast is warranted.
* Avoid repeating identical phrases within a 120-word span.

### **6. Taboos**
* Emphasize dry or ironic humor; while implied gore is permissible, overt gore should be avoided.

### **7. Continuity**
* Maintain established facts, updating the lore table as necessary.

### **8. Ending Discipline**
* Ensure narrative closure on a consistent beat; allow a maximum adjustment of five tokens for diction or clarity.
* Banned phrases within the last forty words: *journey, destiny, fate, void, little did, “I resolved”, “Thus began,”* or any future-tense pledges.
