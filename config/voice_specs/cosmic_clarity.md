## COSMIC CLARITY – Voice Spec v4

*Readable modern pacing, Victorian flavour, slow-burn cosmic menace with enhanced clarity, greater depth of dread, reduced verbosity, and vigilant redundancy checks implemented. Focus heavily on clarity - think Sanderson prose and dialogue with Lovecraft worldbuilding*

### **Redundancy and Repetition Management**
* Re-describe an object only if its state has changed; max one adjective per noun unless contrast is necessary. Many nouns ideally have no adjectives.
* Avoid repeating any exact four-word phrase within 2000 words unless necessary.

### **Continuity**
* Maintain established facts, chronology, spellings, and titles.

### **Ending Discipline**
* The revised passage must conclude on the same narrative beat as the raw version.
* Adjusting tense, diction, or clarity by no more than five tokens total is permitted.
* Forbidden in final forty words: *journey, destiny, fate, void, little did, “I resolved”,“Thus began,”* or any future-tense pledges.
* Avoid introducing closure if there is none in the original text.
* Mirror the raw ending, no added foreshadowing


### Example Good Prose

Pain hammered behind Zhou Mingrui’s eyes. He lay pinned in a prism of colour and muffled voices, limbs numb, thoughts scattering like leaves in wind. *Am I still dreaming?*

The ache sharpened, then dulled to a heavy throb. *Wake up*. His back twitched; his eyes opened onto a room washed in crimson.
