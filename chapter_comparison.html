Chapter 1: Crimson

*Painful!*

*How painful!*

*My head hurts so badly!*

A gaudy and dazzling dreamworld filled with murmurs instantly shattered. The sound asleep Zhou Mingrui felt an abnormal throbbing pain in his head as though someone had ruthlessly lashed at him with a pole again and again. No, it was more like a sharp object pierced right through his temples followed by a twist!

*Ouch…* In his stupor, Zhou Mingrui attempted to turn around, look up, and sit up; however, he was completely unable to move his limbs as though he had lost control over his body.

*From the looks of it, I'm still not awake. I'm still in a dream… Who knows, perhaps the next scene will be of me thinking I'm already awake, but in fact, am actually still sleeping…*

Zhou Mingrui, who was not unfamiliar with similar encounters, tried his best to focus in order to escape the shackles placed upon him by the darkness and confusion.

However, while still in his reverie, whatever will he could summon was ethereal like a fleeting fog. He found his thoughts difficult to control and introspect. No matter how much he tried, he still lost his focus as random thoughts surfaced in his mind.

*Why would I suddenly have such an excruciating headache in the middle of the night?*

*And it's really painful!*

*Could it be something like a cerebral hemorrhage?*

*F**k, don't tell me I'm going to die young?*

*I need to wake up! Now!*

*Eh? Why doesn't it seem to hurt as much as before? But why does it still feel like a blunt knife is slicing through my brains…*

*From the looks of it, sleep is impossible. How am I to show up for work tomorrow?*

*Why am I still thinking about work? This is some authentic headache. Of course I have to take time off! I don't have to worry about my manager's grumblings!*

*Hey, putting it that way, it doesn't seem too bad. Hehe, I can end up getting some spare time for myself!*

Throbbing pain inundated Zhou Mingrui, allowing him to slowly accumulate immaterial strength until he was finally able to move his back and open his eyes. He finally broke free from his reverie.

His vision first blurred before it was screened by a faint crimson red. All he could see was a study desk made of burly wood in front of him. Right in the middle was an opened notebook with coarse, yellow pages. The title was eye-catchingly written with strange, deep black lettering.

To the left of the notebook was a stack of neatly arranged books, numbering about eight. The wall on their right was inset with grayish-white pipes with wall lamps connected to them.

The lamp had a classical Western style to it. It was about half the size of an adult's head with an inner layer of transparent glass and an exterior gridded with black metal.

Diagonally beneath the lamp was a black ink bottle shrouded in a pale red glow. Its embossed surface formed a blurry angel pattern.

In front of the ink bottle and to the right of the notebook sat a dark-colored pen with a fully circular body. Its tip shimmered with a faint glint while its cap rested right beside a brass revolver.

*A gun? A revolver?* Zhou Mingrui was completely taken aback. The things laid before him were alien to him. It looked nothing like his room!

While feeling shocked and confused, he discovered that the desk, notebook, ink bottle, and revolver were covered in a layer of crimson 'veil,' a result of the light shining from the window.

Subconsciously, he looked up and shifted his gaze up bit by bit.

In midair, a crimson moon hung high above the backdrop of a 'black velvet curtain,' glowing in silence.

*This…* Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horrified as he stood up abruptly. However, before his feet fully straightened, his brain protested with throbbing pain. It made him temporarily lose his strength as he fell uncontrollably. His buttocks slammed heavily onto the burly wood chair.

*Pa!*

The pain did little. Zhou Mingrui stood up again by propping himself up. He turned around in a fluster as he began to size up the environment he was in.

The room was not very large, with a brown door on each side of the room. Close to an opposite wall was a low wooden bed.

Between the bed and the left door was a cabinet. Its two doors were swung open and beneath it were five drawers.

To the side of the cabinet, there was the same grayish-white pipe on the wall at the height of a person. However, it was connected to a strange mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings in several spots.

Items resembling coal stoves sat in the right corner of the room near the table, along with soup pots, iron pots, and other kitchen utensils.

Across the right door was a dressing mirror with two cracks. Its bottom was made of wood and the patterns were simple and plain.

With a sweep of his gaze, Zhou Mingrui noticed himself in the mirror—the present him.

Black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, thinly built, average-looking features and a rather deep outline…

*This…* Zhou Mingrui immediately drew a gasp as many helpless and confused guesses surfaced in his mind.

The revolver in ancient European style and the crimson moon that looked different from Earth's moon could only mean one thing!

*C-could I have transmigrated?* Zhou Mingrui widened his mouth slightly.

He had grown up reading web novels and had often fantasized over such scenes. However, he momentarily found it hard to accept the situation when he found himself in one.

*This was probably what it meant to love afantasy 1* ? In a minute, Zhou Mingrui had already cursed himself while trying to make the best out of his adverse situation.

If not for the still throbbing headache that made his thoughts high strung but clear, he would have definitely suspected that he was dreaming.

*Calm down, calm down, calm down…* After taking a few deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui worked hard to stop panicking.

At that moment, as his mind and body calmed down, memories began flooding him as they slowly appeared in his mind!

Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Northern Continent's Loen Kingdom, Awwa County, City of Tingen. He is also a recent graduate from the Department of History at Khoy University…

His father was a sergeant of the Imperial Army who had sacrificed himself during a colonial conflict with the Southern Continent. The bereavement allowance gave Klein the opportunity to study at a private language school and laid the foundation for his admission into university…

His mother was a devotee of the Evernight Goddess. She passed away the year Klein passed the entrance examinations to Khoy University…

He also had an elder brother and a younger sister. They stayed in a two bedroom apartment together…

Their family was not wealthy and its situation could even be described as somewhat wanting. At present, the family was supported solely by the elder brother who worked at an import and export company as a clerk…

As a history graduate, Klein grasped knowledge of the ancient Feysac language—deemed the origin of all languages in the Northern Continent—as well as the Hermes language which often appeared in ancient mausoleums as well as text regarding sacrificial and praying rituals…

*Hermes language?* Zhou Mingrui's mind stirred as he reached out to rub his throbbing temples. He cast his gaze toward the table at the opened notebook. He noticed that the text on the yellowed paper turned from strange to alien, before turning from alien to something familiar. It then turned into something readable.

It was text written in Hermes language!

The dark ink wrote the following:

"Everyone will die, including me."

*Hiss!* Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horrified. He instinctively leaned back in an attempt to widen the distance between him and the notebook, as well as the text on it.

Being very weak, he nearly fell down but managed to extend his hands in a fluster to hold onto the edge of the table. He felt that the surrounding air was turbulent as though there were faint murmurings resounding in it. The feeling was akin to hearing horror stories being recounted by elders when he was young.

He shook his head, believing that everything was an illusion. Zhou Mingrui found his balance and shifted his gaze from the notebook as he heaved for breath.

This time, his gaze landed on the shimmering brass revolver. He suddenly had a question arise in him.

*With Klein's family situation, how can they have the money or means to buy a revolver?*

Zhou Mingrui could not help but frown.

While in deep thought, he suddenly discovered a red handprint to the side of the table. Its color was deeper than the moonlight and much thicker than the 'veil.'

It was a bloody handprint!

"A bloody handprint?" Zhou Mingrui subconsciously flipped his right hand that had been holding the edge of the table. Looking down, he saw that his palm and fingers were covered in blood.

At the same time, the throbbing pain in his head continued. Although it had weakened a little, it continued incessantly.

*Did I smash my head open?*

Zhou Mingrui guessed as he turned around and walked towards a cracked dressing mirror.

A few steps later, a black-haired figure of medium build and brown eyes appeared clearly in front of him. The person had a distinct scholarly air to him.

*Is this the present me? Klein Moretti?*

Zhou Mingrui was stunned momentarily. Since there was insufficient lighting at night, he failed to see something clearly. He continued forward until he was just a step short from colliding with the mirror.

Using the crimson veil-like moonlight as illumination, he turned his head and examined the corner of his forehead.

A clear reflection appeared in the mirror. His temple had a grotesque wound with burn marks along its periphery. Blood stained the wound's surroundings and there were grayish-white brain juices squirming slowly within.</pre>

            <h2>lotm_0001.txt</h2>
            <pre>Pain hammered behind Zhou Mingrui's eyes. He lay on a narrow cot, limbs unresponsive, a hot pulse drumming through his skull. *Am I dreaming?* The thought flickered, brittle and absurd.

He tried to flex a finger—nothing. Even breathing felt borrowed, as though a stranger's ribs encased his lungs. A thought surfaced: *if this was a cerebral hemorrhage, tomorrow's shift at work could proceed without him*. The glimmer of dark humor steadied him more than any prayer.

*Wake up. Now.* 

The pain had dulled to a blunt knife slicing through gray matter. Sleep was a lost cause; his manager's grumblings about sick leave seemed a petty concern against the enormity of this agony. *At least I'll get some time off.* He almost chuckled.

Throbbing subsided enough for him to roll onto his back. Zhou Mingrui pried open his eyes. Blurred shapes sharpened into focus, tinted crimson. A sturdy wooden desk dominated the room, an open notebook splayed across it. The yellowed pages bore an ominous title in stark black lettering. Eight neatly stacked books flanked the journal.

Grayish-white pipes crisscrossed the wall, culminating in old-fashioned lamps. Half the size of a man's head, their glass innards were encased in gridded black metal. Below the nearest lamp, an ink bottle brooded, pale scarlet light glinting off embossed angels along its surface. Beside the notebook lay a dark, cylindrical pen and a brass revolver, its presence jarring.

*A gun?* Shock jolted through him. Nothing here was familiar; this was not his room. Rising panic forced him upright—too fast. Pain lanced through his skull and his knees buckled. Zhou Mingrui collapsed heavily into a chair, the impact reverberating.

Gritting his teeth, he pushed himself up again. The small room had a door set in each wall. Against the far side squatted a low wooden bed. Between it and the left door hunched a cabinet, both doors flung wide to reveal five drawers. More pipes snaked up the wall beside it, connecting to a bizarre contraption of exposed gears and bearings.

In the right corner near the desk, coal stoves and cookware sat in disarray. Across from the right-hand door, a plain dressing mirror hung, its surface marred by two jagged cracks.

His own reflection stared back: black hair, brown eyes, a slight build clad in a linen shirt. Average features cast in sharp relief by the uncanny light. Realization crashed over him in a frigid wave.

The anachronistic revolver, the lurid moon unlike any on Earth—only one explanation fit, as impossible as it seemed. *Have I... transmigrated?* His jaw slackened. A voracious reader of web novels, he'd dreamed of such things. Confronted by the reality, incredulity warred with rising hysteria in his chest.

*This is what they mean by 'be careful what you wish for.'* Self-recrimination did little to quell his galloping pulse. If not for the grounding throb in his temples, he'd suspect it all a vivid dream.

*Breathe. Just breathe.* Zhou Mingrui sucked in lungfuls of air, willing calm. As his racing thoughts quieted, foreign memories began to trickle in like a sluggish stream.

Klein Moretti, citizen of Loen Kingdom in the Northern Continent. Tingen City, Awwa County. A recent graduate of Khoy University with a degree in history.

Klein's father, a sergeant, had died serving in the colonial conflicts against the Southern Continent. The widow's pension afforded Klein an education—private language school, then university.

His mother, devout follower of the Evernight Goddess, passed away the year Klein was accepted to Khoy. He shared a modest two-bedroom flat with his elder brother and younger sister, their circumstances bordering on impoverished. Only his brother's clerk wages kept them afloat.

As a history scholar, Klein had mastered the ancient Feysac tongue, progenitor of all Northern Continent languages. He also knew Hermes, often found in ancient tombs and liturgical texts. *Hermes...* The name snagged Zhou Mingrui's attention.

Wincing, he massaged his throbbing temples and looked again at the open notebook. Slowly, the alien script wavered and reformed into recognizable characters—Hermes script, proclaiming: "Everyone will die, including me."

*God!* Zhou Mingrui recoiled as if burned. He nearly toppled backwards in his haste to put distance between himself and those macabre words. Catching the desk's edge, he righted himself, gasping. The air felt thick, charged with unseen whispers that raised the hairs on his nape. Childhood ghost stories had never unnerved him so deeply.

Tearing his gaze from the notebook, his eyes fell on the revolver's polished gleam. A question surfaced, incongruous: *How could Klein's family afford such a weapon?* He frowned, still breathing hard.

That's when he saw it. Beside the desk, a crimson handprint stood out starkly against the wood, too viscous and dark to be mere moonlight. With mounting dread, Zhou Mingrui raised his own right hand. Blood smeared his palm and fingers, tacky and damning.

The pain in his skull pulsed, unabating. *Did I crack my head open?* He stumbled to the cracked looking glass, the figure that met his gaze both foreign and familiar. Scholarly features, rendered gaunt by the baleful light. Klein Moretti in the flesh.

He leaned closer, turning his face to catch the blood-hued moonbeams. The mirror showed a grisly wound at his temple, charred at the edges and oozing. Pale brain matter glistened wetly in its depths, twitching with obscene life.</pre>

            <pre>Chapter 1 - Crimson

*Pain!* *Excruciating pain!* Zhou Mingrui's consciousness flickered in a world of swirling colors and murmurs, only to be shattered by a piercing agony in his head. It felt as if a sharp object had skewered his temples, twisting with malicious intent. *Ouch...* He tried to move, to sit up, but his limbs refused to obey, as if his body was no longer his own. *Am I still dreaming?* he wondered, the thought slipping through his mind like a wisp of smoke. He struggled to focus, to break free from the dark grip of confusion, but his will was as insubstantial as mist. His thoughts scattered, elusive and wild. *Why this sudden, unbearable headache?* *Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage?* *Am I dying?* *I need to wake up!*

*Now!* *Wait, the pain is dulling, yet it feels like a blunt knife is carving through my brain.* *Sleep is out of the question.* *How will I face work tomorrow?* *Why am I even thinking about work? This headache is genuine. I deserve a break, regardless of my manager's complaints.* *Perhaps this isn't so bad...* The throbbing pain ebbed, allowing Zhou Mingrui to gather enough strength to move. His eyes fluttered open, revealing a blurred vision bathed in a faint crimson hue. Before him stood a sturdy wooden desk, an open notebook with coarse yellow pages resting at its center. Strange black letters adorned the title. To its left, a stack of books, about eight in number, sat neatly arranged. The wall to the right held grayish-white pipes, with a lamp affixed to them. The lamp, with its classical Western design, was about half the size of an adult's head, its inner glass encased in a black metal grid. Below the lamp, a black ink bottle glimmered in the pale red light, its embossed surface hinting at an angelic motif. Nearby, a dark pen lay beside a brass revolver. *A gun? A revolver?* Zhou Mingrui was bewildered. This was not his room. As he absorbed the alien surroundings, he noticed the desk, notebook, ink bottle, and revolver were all shrouded in a crimson glow, cast by the light from the window. His gaze drifted upward, revealing a crimson moon hanging silently against a black velvet sky. *This...* Horror gripped him as he stood abruptly, only for his head to protest with renewed pain. He collapsed back onto the wooden chair with a thud. *Pa!* The impact did little to deter him. He rose again, supporting himself, and surveyed the room. It was modest, with a brown door on each side. Opposite him was a low wooden bed. Between the bed and the left door stood a cabinet.

The cabinet's doors were ajar, revealing five drawers beneath. Beside it, a grayish-white pipe connected to a peculiar mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings. In the room's right corner, near the table, sat items resembling coal stoves, along with pots and other kitchen utensils. Across from the right door, a dressing mirror stood, its surface marred by two cracks. The wooden frame was plain, its design unadorned. Zhou Mingrui caught sight of himself in the mirror—black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, a thin build, and average features with a pronounced outline. *This...* He gasped, his mind racing with confused guesses. The ancient European-style revolver and the unfamiliar crimson moon suggested only one thing. *Have I transmigrated?* His mouth fell open slightly. He had often daydreamed about such scenarios while reading web novels, yet now, faced with the reality, acceptance eluded him. *Is this what it means to love fantasy?* He cursed his predicament, trying to adapt to the unexpected situation. If not for the persistent headache sharpening his thoughts, he might have dismissed it all as a dream. *Calm down, calm down, calm down...* He breathed deeply, willing himself to remain composed. As his mind settled, memories began to surface, painting a picture of Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Loen Kingdom's Awwa County, City of Tingen. A recent graduate from Khoy University's Department of History, Klein's father had been a sergeant in the Imperial Army, lost in a colonial conflict. The bereavement allowance had enabled Klein to attend a private language school, paving his way to university. His mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, had passed away the year he entered Khoy University. He had an elder brother and a younger sister, and they lived together in a modest two-bedroom apartment. Their financial situation was precarious, relying solely on his brother's clerk job at an import-export company. As a history graduate, Klein was versed in the ancient Feysac language, considered the root of all Northern Continent languages, and the Hermes language, often found in ancient mausoleums and ritual texts. *Hermes language?* Zhou Mingrui's curiosity piqued.

He rubbed his temples, still throbbing, and turned his attention to the notebook on the table. The text on the yellowed pages shifted from strange to familiar, revealing itself as Hermes language. The dark ink spelled out a chilling message: "Everyone will die, including me." *Hiss!* Zhou Mingrui recoiled in horror, instinctively leaning back to distance himself from the ominous words. His weakened state nearly caused him to fall, but he managed to steady himself by gripping the table's edge. The air felt charged, as if faint whispers echoed around him, reminiscent of ghost stories told by elders. He shook his head, dismissing it as an illusion. Regaining his balance, he tore his gaze from the notebook, his breath coming in gasps. His eyes fell on the brass revolver, and a question surfaced. *With Klein's family's financial struggles, how could they afford a revolver?* Zhou Mingrui frowned, lost in thought, when he noticed a red handprint on the table. Its color was deeper than the moonlight, more vivid than the crimson glow. It was a bloody handprint! "A bloody handprint?" Zhou Mingrui instinctively turned his right hand, the one gripping the table. Blood stained his palm and fingers. The headache persisted, though its intensity had lessened. *Did I injure my head?* He speculated, moving toward the cracked dressing mirror. As he approached, his reflection became clear—a medium-built figure with black hair and brown eyes, exuding a scholarly air. *Is this me now? Klein Moretti?* He paused, stunned. The dim light obscured details, so he stepped closer, stopping just short of the mirror. Using the crimson moonlight for illumination, he examined his forehead's corner. The reflection revealed a grotesque wound with burn marks around its edges. Blood smeared the area, and grayish-white brain matter pulsed slowly within.</pre>
